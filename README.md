# arduino-weather-station

## A simple Arduino-based weather station.

### Description

This is a simple Arduino project that uses a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity, and an LCD to display the information.

### Requirements

- An Arduino, I used an Arduino UNO, but most others should work fine.
- A DHT11 sensor. (<£2)
- A 16x2 LCD. (~£5)
- A breadboard and wires!

### Instructions to use

- Clone this repo or download the arduino-weather-station.ino file.
- Open the arduino-weather-station.ino file in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- You'll need to add the [LiquidCrystal](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/liquidcrystal/) and [DHT11](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DHT11Lib/) libraries.
- Wire together your Arduino of choice with the DHT11 sensor and LCD.
- Upload the sketch to your Arduino and enjoy!
